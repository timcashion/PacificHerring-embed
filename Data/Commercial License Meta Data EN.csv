Field Names and Descriptions for DFO Pacific Region Commercial Licence data file.,
,
Field Name,Description
PUBLISHED DATE,Date and time that this record was published.
LICENCE PREFIX,"Licence Prefix.  Identifies the fishery for which this licence was issued.  For example, the ""AS""  Licence Prefix indicates that the licence was issued for the Salmon Seine fishery.  Other Licence Prefixes are defined in the ""Commercial Licence Types (Licence Prefixes)"" Reference Data report."
LICENCE ROOT,Unique number distinguishing this Licence from other Licences with the same Licence Prefix.
LICENCE SUFFIX,"Fishing year or season to which the Licence applies.  If the season spans more than one calendar year, then the first calendar year is used.  For example, the ""2014/2015"" season would have a Suffix of ""2014""."
LICENCE TAB,"Licence Tab is the concatenation of the Licence Prefix, Root and Suffix. For example, ""L 411 2014"" translates to the Halibut Fishery, licence number 411 in the 2014/2015 season."
LICENCE STATUS,"Status of the licence as of the PUBLISHED_DTT.  Status values include: ""APPLICATION"", ""APPROVAL PENDING"", ""EXPIRED"", ""RENEWAL"", ""RETIRED TO AFS"", ""RETIRED/RELINQUISHED"", ""VALID"" and ""VOLUNTARILY RETIRED""."
LIEL_SEQ,"Licence Eligibility Sequence.  This identifier is used to track the eligibility to have a Licence in a limited entry fishery.  The same LIEL_SEQ value will appear in all Commercial Licences issued to that eligibility in all seasons.  For example, all licences issued to T 10 in any season (i.e. T 10 2014, T 10 2013, T 10 2012, etc.) will have the same LIEL_SEQ.  This value can be very helpful in tracking the history of a Licence.  Note: even if a Licence is retired and is reissued as a F Licence, it will retain the same LIEL_SEQ."
LICENCE ISSUE DATE,"Date that the Licence was issued (i.e. LICENCE STATUS became ""VALID"").  Note that some older records do not have this value populated."
LICENCE EXPIRY DATE,"Date that the Licence became (or is to become) ""EXPIRED"".  Note that some older records do not have this value populated."
FISHERY GROUP,"Name of the Fishery Group.  Can be useful in grouping related licences with different Licence Prefixes together.  For example, the ""SALMON SEINE"" Fishery Group will include all Salmon Seine Licences regardless of whether they have the ""AS"", ""ASA"", ""ASB"", ""FAS"", ""FASA"" or ""FASB"" Licence Prefix."
AREA,"Fishery specific Licence Area option (or selection) where it is applicable.  For example, Geoduck and Horseclam Licences may have an AREA of ""GEODUCK AREA G"", ""GEODUCK AREA N"" or ""GEODUCK AREA W"".  See the ""Commercial Licence Areas"" Reference Data report for other Licence Area examples and definitions."
LICENCE TYPE,"Licence Type.  Licence types can be either ""PARTY-BASED"" (meaning that the Licence is held by a party) or ""VESSEL-BASED"" (meaning that the Licence is held by a Vessel)."
LICENCE HOLDER TYPE,"Licence Holder Type.  For ""VESSEL-BASED"" Licences, this value is always ""VESSEL"".  For ""PARTY-BASED"" Licences, these values reflect the type of party that holds the Licence.  See values listed in ""Licence Holder Types"" tab."
