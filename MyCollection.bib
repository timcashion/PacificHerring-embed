abstract = {Proposal To seek Governor in Council approval to remit {\$}93,750 in funds collected in respect of roe herring fishing licences for the 2014 fishing season, pursuant to subsection 23(2.1) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA). Objective The purpose of the Order in Council is to remit {\$}93,750 in certain annual commercial fishing licence fees for roe herring that were paid in respect of the 2014 fishing season, pursuant to subsection 19(1) of the Pacific Fishery Regulations, 1993, and that are set out in subsections 3(9) and (10) of Part I of Schedule II to those Regulations. Background The West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI) is one of five stock areas for the commercial herring fishery in British Columbia. This area has been closed to general commercial herring fishing since 2006 due to conservation reasons. However, on December 23, 2013, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans made a decision to allow for the opening of the 2014 WCVI commercial herring fishery. In 2014, there were 1 267 roe herring gillnet and 252 roe herring seine licenses issued for five herring stock fishing areas, including the WCVI. These licences are renewed on January 1 every year. In this current situation, licence holders had paid their annual fees in January 2014 and completed area selection on February 5, 2014. Licence issuance for roe herring licences was delayed and occurred from February 18 to 20, 2014. On February 12, 2014, the Ahousaht, Ehattesaht, Hesquiaht, Mowachaht/Muchalaht and Tla-o-qui-aht First Nations filed a motion for an interlocutory injunction to prohibit the opening of a commercial roe herring fishery on the WCVI. On February 21, 2014, the Federal Court granted an interlocutory injunction prohibiting the opening of the 2014 commercial roe herring fishery on the WCVI pending the hearing of a judicial review application brought by the five aforementioned First Nations. As a result of the interlocutory injunction, the commercial roe herring fishery on the WCVI remained closed in 2014, and holders of commercial licences to fish for roe herring on the WCVI were unable to fish in that area in 2014. As a result, the licence holders of 23 gillnet and 25 seine licences, which had been paid for and were issued for the WCVI roe herring fishing area, were no longer able to use them. Remission is recommended on the basis that it is in the public interest to refund the licence fees to the affected licence holders. Retention of the licence fees would be contrary to the public interest, as it would unfairly disadvantage (financially) the licence holders who paid the necessary fees to fish for roe herring on the WCVI, but who were then subsequently unable to fish as a result of the interlocutory injunction granted by the Federal Court. This was a circumstance beyond the control of the licence holders. Implications The licence fees, representing a total amount of {\$}93,750, will be reimbursed to the affected licence holders.

abstract = {Distribution and associated concentration of access rights are critically important in assessing the functioning and benefits of a fishery, and understanding who controls access to fisheries is therefore of ever increasing importance. There is a growing dependence on market-based approaches that in turn rely on healthy, functioning markets to achieve economic outcomes. As well, social goals of equity and fairness in fisheries have re-emerged as priorities alongside the goals of ecological sustainability and economic efficiency. This study aims to address the past and present state of the concentration of fishing licenses in British Columbia's salmon and herring fisheries. Fisheries administrative data from federal and provincial data sets were mined to develop a timeline of fisheries ownership and control over a twenty-year period. Hidden corporate ownership of licenses through subsidiaries was identified and comprehensive criteria were co-identified with industry representatives to characterize the various user groups of fisheries licenses. Our analysis suggests that from 1993 to 2012, there was a notable shift in the ownership profile of salmon and herring licenses, with a marked increase in concentration of licenses owned by fish processors.},

@article{McGrath2015a,
abstract = {In salmonid aquaculture, a variety of technologies have been deployed that attempt to limit a range of environmental impacts associated with net-pen culture. One such technology employs a floating, solid-walled enclosure as the primary culture environment, providing greater potential control over negative interactions with surroundings waters while limiting energy use required for water circulation, thermo-regulation and supplemental oxygen provision. Here, we utilize life cycle assessment to model contributions to a suite of global-scale resource depletion and environmental concerns (including global warming potential, acidification potential, marine eutrophication potential, cumulative energy use, and biotic resource use) of such a technology deployed commercially to rear Chinook salmon in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Results indicate that at full grow-out, feed provisioning and on-site energy use dominate contributions across four of five impact categories assessed. For example, per tonne of salmon harvested, feed contributed approximately 72{\%} to global warming potential, 72{\%} to acidification potential, and accounted for 100{\%} of biotic resource use. However, for both feed and on-site energy use, impacts are heavily influenced by specific sources of inputs; therefore efforts to improve the environmental performance of this technology should focus on reducing these in favor of less impactful alternatives.},

abstract = {We present a global-scale life cycle assessment of a major food commodity, farmed salmon. Specifically, we report the cumulative energy use, biotic resource use, and greenhouse gas, acidifying, and eutrophying emissions associated with producing farmed salmon in Norway, the UK, British Columbia (Canada), and Chile, as well as a production-weighted global average. We found marked differences in the nature and quantity of material/energy resource use and associated emissions per unit production across regions. This suggests significant scope for improved environmental performance in the industry as a whole. We identify key leverage points for improving performance, most notably the critical importance of least-environmental cost feed sourcing patterns and continued improvements in feed conversion efficiency. Overall, impacts were lowest for Norwegian production in most impact categories, and highest for UK farmed salmon. Our results are of direct relevance to industry, policy makers, eco-labeling programs, and consumers seeking to further sustainability objectives in salmon aquaculture.},

abstract = {This report, prepared for Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Pacific Region by Stuart Nelson of Nelson Bros Fisheries Ltd, provides estimates of commercial fishing fleet financial performance for vessels operating in the major West Coast commercial fisheries for the year 2009. This report is substantially an update of a similar report prepared for the 2007 year, though there are some key differences in methodology: • Three fisheries have been added: ZN (inside and outside), lingcod, and dogfish. • Weights and prices are in kilograms. • The presentation of diversification for each fishery category has been amended to better reflect revenues derived from other fisheries. • Other changes are highlighted in the body of the report. For each fishery, the following information is presented: fishery overview, licensing profile, landings profile, key assumptions, financial profiles, capital considerations, and comparison to 2007 results. The key measure of financial performance used in the schedules is EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization). This is a measure of cash flow to the vessel owner that reflects operating performance but does not include capital or non-­‐cash charges. While each BC commercial fishing fleet category features certain common elements, there are still a wide variety of revenue/cost structures and settlement arrangements within fisheries. The financial schedules provided attempt to encapsulate representative results for each fleet, but readers should recognize that a host of alternative treatments could also apply.},
